# Comparison-among-Different-Manifold-Learning-Algorithms-and-Application-on-Classification

Before analyzing large data sets in the machine learning, one signiÔ¨Åcant problem is how to simplify these data sets, namely how to discover the problem of dimension reduction. We introduce the notation Manifold to construct a low-dimensional manifold for data embedding into a high-dimensional space. In this paper, we discuss several algorithms for manifold learning and applications to the synthetic data and the real Image problem.
